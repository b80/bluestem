A Ruby on Rails emailing list manager

This project proposes to create an alternative to mailing list managers such as GNU Mailman (http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html) and Majordomo (http://wwww.greatcircle.com) using Ruby on Rails.

The Bulestem mailing list manager has capability of creating new list, adding users to list, having encrypted list with public key for mailer

It looks like a gneral-purpose request system. It is targeting for digesting or handling all user requests at the same time. Our approach is keep the backend actions flexible as also for the need to work with variety SMTP servers. The intended usage of the work could be used as the basis for a blog or content management system too.
